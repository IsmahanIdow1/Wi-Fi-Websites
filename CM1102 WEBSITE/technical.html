        <h3> Wi-Fi Standards and Frequency </h3>
    <p>Wi-Fi uses IEEE 802.11 protocool and works with Ethernet.</span><br> The devices connect using WAP (Wireless Access Point).</span><br>
        Most Wi-Fi uses 2.4 GHz and the later versions uses 6 GHz whiles the older ones used 5 GHz.</span><br>
        So then one equitment can carry channels at a time.</p>
    
    <p class="par">
        <h3> Wi-Fi Range and Line-of-Sight Weakenesses</h3>
    <p> Wi-Fi works using line of sight,so if there is something disrupting the line of sight then the signal will be reduced.</span><br>
        A normal access point can range to around 20 meters when it is inside but some specific can go up to 150 when outside.</span><br>
        Whereas a hotspot can only cover one room. But we seen as the years went on that Wi-Fi speed has upgraded </span><br> and in 2019 
        some even reach up to "9.6 Gbits/s" at close proximity. </p>
