    <h3>Beginning of Wi-Fi</h3>

    <p> The journey of technical change and preformance was shown through the progression of Wi-Fi.</span><br>
        It all started in 1997 where the preformance was slow and was unreliable whereas now Wi-Fi </span><br>
        has progressed 
        into what is is today.</p>
    <h3>The progression of Wi-Fi</h3>

    <h3> Who Created Wi-Fi?</h3>
    <p> Wi-Fi was invented by Dr.John O'Sulivan as he worked in a team to then came into real life in 1991.
        This was then patented in Australia </span><br> in 1992 and then in the US in 1996 which then lead to high speed 
        wireless connection that we have now. Then we seen in 1999 WECA took over </span><br> to make this more accessible to 
        users to use all over the world.</p>
    <p>We see in the begining Wi-Fi was an accidental creation. Researchers were trying to figure out a solution
        in radio astronomy. </span><br> While they were doing this they made a chip that cleaned up radio signals.
         Which then aided them in sending data without wire,</span><br> which then lead to Wi-Fi being made.</p>
    
    <h3>The problems that comes with Wi-Fi</h3>
    <p>We see that Wi-Fi has had great progression throughtout the years but it hasn't been as easy as it seen.</span><br>
        The main problem their has been is the risk of hacking that has come with Wi-Fi networks. </span><br> So although their is great
         progress cyber attack is a main issue which then make it hard for wireless connection to be 100% safe.</p>
    <p> Futhermore, Wi-Fi also faces problems with the speed and connectivity this is because we see Wi-Fi use direct line of sight</span><br>
        and it can easily be intervne with when it comes signal. Which then lower the range and makes connecting slower.</span><br>
        We see this as if alot of people are trying to connect to one network it seems to lag and the speed slows down which make it impractical to use.</p>
    
    <h3> What is coming up next for the future of Wi-Fi?</h3>
    <p> Wi-Fi is not at its end of development it will proceed to develop further and allow more devices to use the internet at once.</span><br>
        Later models for example the 6th one is made to make sure you get quicker speed and better quality in public settings
        and allow you </span><br> to have strong efficiency in both your house and also in big offices.</p>
    <p>We see the invention of VR and AR and how they will be using wireless connections. There will also be Li-Fi and other systems </span><br>e.g. 6G which
        will allow for wireless connection to expand and keep Wi-Fi a key part on how data is connected. </p>
